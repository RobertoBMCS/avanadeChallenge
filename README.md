Avanade Java Spring Boot training challenge, a D&D-based game was created using only RESTful API.

To play it works like this:

1 - Create the "Creatures" in the Creatures package that will make up the game (Both the one you will play and the enemy/adversary)

2 - Create your character name and link it to a creature in the Player package.

3 - Create the battle and tell who you want to face using the Playing Game package.

4 - After that, just keep "updating" the battle and the turns are taken automatically.
